Reshaping and Visualizing Data with Pandas and Lets-Plot This project focuses on reshaping, cleaning, and visualizing product price data using Pandas, NumPy, and Lets-Plot in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

Key Features: Data Preprocessing:

Merging multiple .csv files into a single Pandas DataFrame. Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent price formats. Converting prices to a uniform float format using a custom clean_item_price() function. Exploratory Data Analysis:

Computing descriptive statistics (mean, median, quartiles, standard deviation) for item prices across categories. Identifying products listed under multiple categories using groupby() and nunique(). Data Visualization:

Plotting price distribution per category using Lets-Plot. Creating interactive tooltips for better insights. Highlighting median, Q1, and Q3 values in the visualization.
